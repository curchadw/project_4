## Real Estate App

- This App is my 4th project while at Flatiron. The purpose of this project was for me to demostrate my understanding of the fundamentals of JavaScripts. The theme of this project is me imagining I am building a app on managing a real estate brokers listing with applicable information regrading that listing. Though this is not the most amazing project just yet, this helped me understand learn how to get more comfortable with using Vanilla JS without frameworks. There is still a ways for me to go in this journey, but I am further along than I ah ever been.

## Technologies

- I used on the frontend JS/HTML/CSS/Bootstrap 4.5
- On the backend I utilized Rails 6.0 API

## Running the App

- For now you will need change directories in the the frontend folder and run the http-server command from a terminal, and the backend you will need to open a sperate terminal and cd backend > cd real_estate(don't ask how this mistake was made), and run the rails server.
